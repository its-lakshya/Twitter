# Twitter

### [Project Link](https://its-lakshya.github.io/Twitter/)

This project is a clone of the Twitter home page, created with HTML and CSS. The project aims to replicate the layout, design, and functionality of the original website, using only front-end technologies. The project features responsive elements such as hover effects, icons, and buttons. The project demonstrates the use of semantic HTML, CSS grid and flexbox, and media queries to create a modern and user-friendly web page.

The project is suitable for beginners who want to practice their web development skills and learn from a real-world example.

### Responsiveness

The web application will be responsive, meaning that it will adapt to different screen sizes and devices. I will use media queries and flexbox to achieve this. Media queries are a feature of CSS that allow us to apply different styles depending on certain conditions, such as the width or height of the screen. Flexbox is a layout mode of CSS that allows us to align and distribute items in a flexible way.
